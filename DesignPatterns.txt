What are design patterns?
-------------------------
Design patterns are common architectural approaches which designers have observed through out the years and desided to cataloge them and give a name so those could commonly used and discussed.
These came into in to popularity when a book called Design Patterns came in being by 4 authors most commonly known as Gang of Four in 1994.

These patterns are now very much universaly relevant and some of these patterns even became internalized in the programming languages itself.

There are broadly three types of design patterns:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Creational
   - Builder
   - Factories
   	  - Abstract Factory
   	  - Factory Method
   - Prototype
   - Singleton

2. Structural
   - Adapter
   - Bridge
   - Composite
   - Decorator
   - Facade
   - Flyweight
   - Proxy

3. Behavioral
   - Chain of Responsibility
   - Command
   - Interpreter
   - Iterator
   - Mediator
   - Memento
   - Observer
   - State
   - Strategy
   - Template Method
   - Visitor

Let's now follow all the design patterns which are there in the original design pattern book from 1994.
